# Welcome to ViUR Vi. #

Vi is the web-based administration tool for ViUR-based information systems.
To get Vi run, it has to be built in your projects appengine folder.

The conceptional best approach is to add the vi build-directory as a submodule
to your repository, and build it within this directory for your ViUR-based
Google AppEngine appliance.


## DEPENDENCIES ##

The Vi backend is a HTML5-based web-application implemented on top of PyJS.
Therefore, a PyJS build-environment must exist. To build all related files,
there is also a compiler for the LESS overlay language required (lessc).


## BUILDING VI ##

Vi comes with a simple Makefile run by GNU make to get the compilation tasks
and dependencies done.

By default, vi is built into a directory called "vi" of the vi working
directory. In an advanced setup (project based setup), vi can also be built into the folder ../appengine/vi, up one level of the working directory, which makes vi suitable as a submodule of a Google AppEngine project.

After checking out vi, simply move into the working directory and type:

	make setup
	make

To get all basic setups done.


## ADDITIONAL TARGETS ##

To clean the vi output folder, run

	make clean

To build an optimized version without debugging output, type

	make deploy


Have fun! :)
